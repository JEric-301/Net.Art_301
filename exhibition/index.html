    <h1>Black Expression in <br> the Digital Age</h1>
    <h2>Curated by Eric Cho</h2>
    <br> 
    <p>This exhibition showcases how Net Art has been utilized as a medium of dissent and social critique, 
      particularly in addressing racial injustice and systemic inequality in this society. The works exhibited 
      include Blackness for Sale by Keith Obadike, Rent-A-Negro by Damali Ayo, and Keeping Up Appearances by 
      Meni Obadike. All of these works express or imply frustration and anger toward the injustice and inequality 
      rooted in racism, using the internet itself as a stage for critique. 
      <br> <br> Both Blackness for Sale and Rent-A-Negro 
      satirize the common perception of black people’s lives or past, revealing harsh realities black people have been enduring. 
      Keeping Up Appearances highlights the pressures and oppressions commonly experienced by Black women. Together, these works 
      illustrate how net art serves not only as an innovative art piece but also as an effective tool for resistance and amplifying 
      the voices of those who are ignored or suppressed in society.

    <p class="caption">Rent-A-Negro is satirical net art that presents a fictional service renting a 
      Black person to clients for social or cultural capital. This exposes the ongoing objectification and 
      exploitation of Black people and labor online.

    <p class="caption">Keith Obadike put his “Blackness” on eBay for sale. This criticizes 
      how Black identity and culture are commodified, presenting “pros and cons” of blackness to expose 
      societal stereotypes and the reduction of Black people to cultural capital in digital and capitalist spaces.

    <p class="caption">Keeping Up Appearances is a minimalist hypertext net art piece that reveals hidden 
      text when the cursor hovers over the screen. The hidden lavender texts with black texts together reveal Mendi 
      Obadike’s uncomfortable and unequal relationship she experienced as a young Black woman.
