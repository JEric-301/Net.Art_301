    <h1>Black Expression in <br> the Digital Age</h1>
    <h4>Curated by Eric Cho</h4>

    <p>
      This exhibition showcases how net art has been utilized as a medium of dissent and social critique,
      particularly in addressing racial injustice, systemic inequality, and digital mediation of Black identity.
      Spanning the early 2000s to the 2010s, the works exhibited here directly and indirectly express frustration 
      and anger toward injustice rooted in racism, using the internet itself as a stage for critique.
      <br><br>
      Early net art works, including <i>Rent-A-Negro</i> (2003), <i>Blackness for Sale</i> (2001), 
      <i>Keeping Up Appearances</i> (2001), and <i>The Interaction of Coloreds</i> (2002), use satire, hypertext, 
      and interactivity to reveal the commodification of Black identity and the persistence of colorism.
      <br><br>
      Works such as <i>Black Bieber</i> (2014) and <i>The Black Factory</i> (2003–2004) expand these critiques 
      into cultural appropriation and community participation, using GIFs, objects, and digital archives 
      to question how Blackness is circulated and consumed.
      <br><br>
      Later projects such as <i>New Black Portraitures</i> (2017) and <i>Art Thoughtz</i> (2010–2012) examine 
      how digital platforms shape visibility, self-representation, and cultural authority. Through VR, video, 
      social media performance, and satire, they expose how online spaces construct and police Black identity 
      while also revealing the power of audiences in reinforcing or resisting systemic hierarchies.
      <br><br>
      Together, these works illustrate how net art operates not only as an innovative artistic medium but also 
      as a tool for resistance, self-expression, and amplification of voices historically marginalized due to race.
