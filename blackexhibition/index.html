  <h1>Black Expression in <br> the Digital Age</h1>
  <h4 class="curator">Curated by Eric Cho</h4>

  <p>
    This exhibition showcases how net art has been utilized as a medium of dissent and social critique, particularly in addressing racial injustice, systemic inequality, and digital mediation of Black identity. Spanning the early 2000s to the 2010s, the works exhibited here directly and indirectly express frustration and anger toward injustice rooted in racism, using the internet itself as a stage for critique.
    <br><br>
    Early net art works, including <i>Rent-A-Negro</i> (2003), <i>Blackness for Sale</i> (2001), <i>Keeping Up Appearances</i> (2001), and <i>The Interaction of Coloreds</i> (2002), use satire, hypertext, and interactivity to reveal the commodification of Black identity and the persistence of colorism.
    <br><br>
    Works such as <i>Black Bieber</i> (2014) and <i>The Black Factory</i> (2003–2004) expand these critiques into cultural appropriation and community participation, using GIFs, objects, and digital archives to question how Blackness is circulated and consumed.
    <br><br>
    Later projects such as <i>New Black Portraitures</i> (2017) and <i>Art Thoughtz</i> (2010–2012) examine how digital platforms shape visibility, self-representation, and cultural authority.
    <br><br>
    Together, these works illustrate how net art operates not only as an innovative artistic medium but also as a tool for resistance, self-expression, and amplification of voices historically marginalized due to race.
