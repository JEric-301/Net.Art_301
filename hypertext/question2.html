        <p>The immune system is definitely one of the most interesting topics in biology! By learning how the human immune system</p>
        <p>works, you begin to understand how your body reacts when you get sick or injured. As you gain more knowledge about it, you</p>
        <p>will be amazed by the clever ways your body defends against different antigens. For me, the immune system is one of my favorite subjects!</p>
