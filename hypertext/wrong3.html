        <h2>Incorrect Answer :[</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Correct Answer was: Vitamin D</h3>
        <br>

        
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The correct answer is Vitamin D. While Vitamin D is often associated solely with</p>
        <p>strong bones and calcium absorption, its role in the body is far more extensive.</p>
        <p>It actually functions much like a hormone and is crucial for regulating hundreds of genes</p>
        <p>that control cell growth, immune function, and reduction of inflammation. A unique </p>
        <p>feature is that our bodies can synthesize Vitamin D when the skin is exposed to </p>
        <p>sunlight, making it one of the few vitamins we don't rely completely on diet for, but</p>
        <p>consistent sun exposure and dietary intake are both necessary to avoid deficiency and</p>
        <p>ensure optimal body function. </p>

        <p>When you study biology, you learn about different nutrients and their crucial roles in the human body. I decided to give you</p>
        <p>this question because I've recently realized how taking sufficient amounts of vitamins can significantly improve one's quality of life.</p>
        <p>Understanding these essential nutrients is key to personal health. Eat your vegetables!</p>
