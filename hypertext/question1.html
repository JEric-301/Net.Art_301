        <p>When studying biology, one of the few topics that holds you back is physiology. Specifically, when learning the circulation</p>
        <p>system, you study the heart, and the structure of the heart can be confusing when you first learn it. It took me a little while</p>
        <p>to understand it initially, but soon I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the circulatory system and how the human body is maintained.</p>
