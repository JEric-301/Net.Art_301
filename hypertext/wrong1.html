        <h2>Incorrect Answer :[</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Correct Answer was: Four</h3>
        <br>

        
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The human heart is composed of four chambersâ€”two upper atria and two lower ventricles. 
        <p>This four-chambered structure is vital because it ensures that oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-poor blood are
        <p>kept completely separate. The right side of the heart handles blood coming back from the body </p>
        <p>to be sent to the lungs (pulmonary circulation), while the left side handles the clean blood coming </p>
        <p>back from the lungs to be pumped out to the rest of the body (systemic circulation). This complete </p>
        <p>separation is what allows the human body to maintain the extremely high efficiency and oxygen </p>
        <p>supply needed for warm-blooded life.</p>

        <p>When studying biology, one of the few topics that holds you back is physiology. Specifically, when learning the circulation</p>
        <p>system, you study the heart, and the structure of the heart can be confusing when you first learn it. It took me a little while</p>
        <p>to understand it initially, but soon I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the circulatory system and how the human body is maintained.</p>
