        <h2>Incorrect Answer :[</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Correct Answer was: O-</h3>
        <br>

        
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The correct answer is O- (O Negative) because this blood type lacks two major types of</p>
        <p>identification tags (antigens): the A and B antigens and the Rh factor antigen.</p>
        <p>Since O- blood has no antigens on its red blood cells, it is not recognized as foreign by the </p>
        <p>recipient's immune system, regardless of their own blood type. This unique quality makes </p>
        <p>O- the safest option for emergency transfusions when a patient's blood type is </p>
        <p>unknown, earning it the title of "Universal Donor."

        <p>The immune system is definitely one of the most interesting topics in biology! By learning how the human immune system</p>
        <p>works, you begin to understand how your body reacts when you get sick or injured. As you gain more knowledge about it, you</p>
        <p>will be amazed by the clever ways your body defends against different antigens. For me, the immune system is one of my favorite subjects!</p>
